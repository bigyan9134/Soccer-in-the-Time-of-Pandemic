# Soccer-in-the-Time-of-Pandemic

An analysis of the 2020/21 Premier League Soccer Season to study the impact of pandemic in the performance of top and bottom 
finishing teams.

Cleaning, filtering and transforming of data that was scraped from the official Premier League website was done using Python
libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Scipy.

This analysis then dives into the statistics from 28 years of soccer matches in the English Premier League, performs several
hypothesis tests to understand how the Pandemic affected season differed from the previous years. It discovers important and
statistically significant differences between the previous all seasons and pandemic affected season especially in regards to
how the Home teams have let their performance levels drop significantly in the absence of Home Team supporters in the stadium
due to pandemic-related restrictions.

The findings of this analysis could help the teams identify and pinpoint what aspect of their games needs to be addressed as
a result of the absence of the supporters in the stadium.
